But it still gives a nice view and photos can turn out nice.\n\nThe park is divided in two by Wilshire Boulevard. The southern portion primarily consists of a lake, while the northern half includes an amphitheatre, bandshell, soccer fields, and a children's playground along with a recreation center operated by the city of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. The bandshell was once home to many organizations and events such as &quot;Jugaremos en Familia&quot; (a live event hosted by Memo Flores for the Hispanic community). MacArthur Park's bandshell has been recently renovated as the Levitt Pavilion is once again the host of jazz, big band, salsa music, and world music concerts. Since reopening it hosts at least 50 free concerts each summer between June and September.\n\nThe lake in MacArthur Park is fed by natural springs (although an artificial bottom to the lake was laid during the construction of the Metro Red Line, opened in 1993). In the past, a fountain with a reflecting pool on the northern end was also fed by the springs. The Westlake/MacArthur Park Red Line station sits across the street.\n\n""}",california ca travel usa lake storm building water fountain clouds canon landscape la photo losangeles downtown day cloudy picture photographers highrise southerncalifornia hdr macarthurpark adjust infocus 2011 photomatix tonemapped losangelesdepartmentofrecreationandparks denoise 60d topazlabs ltravel photographersnaturecom davetoussaint,34.059072,-118.278797,16,0,.8YMrEJTUb.n66xZqg,23511980,1,0,0,0

Westlake Park was re-named May 7, 1942; Eastlake Park was re-named Lincoln Park.In the mid-1800s the area was a swampland; by the 1890s, it was a vacation destination, surrounded by luxury hotels. In the early part of the twentieth century, the MacArthur park area became known as the Champs-Élysées of Los Angeles.  Wilshire Boulevard formerly ended at the lake, but in 1934 a berm was built for it to cross and link up with the existing Orange Street (which ran from Alvarado to Figueroa) into downtown Los Angeles. Orange Street was renamed Wilshire and extended east of Figueroa to Grand Ave. This divided the lake into two halves; the northern one was subsequently drained. According to a Los Angeles Times news story from 1956, two swans named Rudie and Susie welcomed their five new baby cygnets on the island in MacArthur Park Lake, and according to the park superintendent, these were the first swans born in the park in over a decade.[3]&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarthur_Park"" rel=""nofollow""> - Wikipedia</a>  \n\nThis was made on Friday the 13th of June 2008.\n\n\nMade with <a href=""http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK"" rel=""nofollow"">CHDK</a> technology.\n\nThe Powershot <a href=""http://www.tradica.com/0a/SD1200IS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SD1200IS / IXUS95IS</a>is NOT ported yet, there\'s NO CHDK available for this camera.\n\nA few links about the <a href=""http://www.tradica.com/20091119/"" rel=""nofollow"">American Cement Building</a>\n\nneat.\n\n\nPerhaps  <a href=""http://www.tradica.com/20100211/"" rel=""nofollow"">Moziklip</a>?'}",park plaza building hotel la los angeles cement westlake american asbury eastlosangeles fridaythe13th wilshire royale macarthur alvarado macarthurpark fonda champsélysées downtownlosangeles orangestreet langers parklake wilshireboulevard westlakepark twohalves eastlakepark vacationdestination flickrtradicacom playstationlofts fridayteh13th macarthurparklake,34.061156,-118.278583,16,0,ToHTGYlTUb_9VUFW5A,23511981,1,0,0,0
